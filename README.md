# wgpu-experiments

Messing around with wgpu ðŸ¦€ðŸ”º

## Instructions

This repo uses Trunk to target the browser, checkout the list of commands: <https://trunkrs.dev/commands/> Otherwise, `justfile` contains instructions on how to build the package manually.

Alternatively, use cargo normally to target native, eg. `cargo run`

One last thing! check the shaders with `cargo wgsl`
